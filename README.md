## 🎯 Why Open Source?

I've made this code public for several reasons:

1. **Community Collaboration**: If you're interested in contributing features, bug fixes, or improvements, you're welcome to submit pull requests
2. **Transparency**: The Toronto community can see exactly how their data is handled and stored
3. **Feedback Welcome**: If you spot security issues, bugs, or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue
